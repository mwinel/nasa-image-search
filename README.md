## NASA Image Search

This is a simple web app that allows you to search images by [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/).

## Demo Link

```
https://nasa-image-search-three.vercel.app/
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Storybook

The frontend UI components are built (into a Design System), tested, reviewed and packaged in isolation using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

The design system can be found here [NASA Image Search design system](https://6367f0aed37a0a2c90b92438-vtljkbsxjg.chromatic.com/?path=/story/nasa-image-search-introduction--page).

Run story book:

```bash
npm run storybook
# or
yarn storybook
```
