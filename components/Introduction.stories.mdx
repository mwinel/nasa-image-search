# The NASA IMAGE SEARCH design system

The NASA IMAGE SEARCH design system tutorial is a subset of the full [NASA IMAGE SEARCH design system](https://github.com/mwinel/nasa-image-search), created when I was trying to learn how to use Storybook. 

It is a great tool for creating a design system and I highly recommend it.
